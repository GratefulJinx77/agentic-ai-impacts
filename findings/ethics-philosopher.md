## Executive Summary

Autonomous agentic AI represents a qualitative shift in the relationship between humans and their tools. Unlike previous technologies that extended human capability while leaving human agency intact, agentic AI *substitutes* for human judgment, decision-making, and action. This is not merely a faster calculator or a more efficient assembly line --- it is a system that decides, plans, and acts with diminishing human involvement.

The central ethical tension is not whether agentic AI produces good or bad outcomes (it does both), but whether the *structure* of the human-AI relationship it creates is compatible with human flourishing, democratic governance, and a just society. Our analysis identifies seven critical ethical fault lines:

1. **Power is concentrating, not democratizing.** Despite rhetoric of accessibility, the infrastructure of agentic AI consolidates control among a handful of corporations, creating asymmetries of capability that rival governmental power without corresponding accountability.

2. **Human skills are eroding measurably, not hypothetically.** Evidence from medicine, law, accounting, and education shows that delegation to AI systems degrades human competence within months, not years --- and the degradation may be irreversible at organizational scale.

3. **The information ecosystem is approaching a structural crisis.** The problem is not merely that deepfakes exist, but that their existence undermines trust in *all* media, creating an epistemic environment where shared facts become impossible.

4. **Moral responsibility is genuinely fragmenting.** The "accountability gap" is not merely a legal technicality but a philosophical problem: as the chain of causation between human intent and AI action lengthens, traditional frameworks of moral responsibility become inadequate.

5. **The augmentation/replacement distinction is collapsing.** Empirical evidence shows a 0.87 correlation between roles experiencing automation and augmentation simultaneously --- the same jobs are being both enhanced and hollowed out.

6. **Informed consent has become structurally impossible** in many agentic AI contexts, where systems take actions that users cannot predict, understand, or meaningfully authorize in advance.

7. **Structural inequality is being amplified, not disrupted.** The AI divide tracks and deepens existing inequalities along lines of wealth, geography, race, and institutional access.

These are not speculative risks. They are observable dynamics with measurable consequences occurring now. Reasonable people will disagree about the appropriate responses, but the ethical seriousness of these challenges should not be in dispute.

## 1. Power Dynamics: Who Gains, Who Loses

### The Concentration Thesis

The empirical evidence on power concentration is unambiguous: agentic AI capability is concentrating among a small number of corporations at a speed and scale unprecedented in the history of technology. Approximately 100 companies --- overwhelmingly in the United States and China --- account for more than 40% of global private AI investment. The Agentic AI Foundation, launched in December 2025 by Anthropic, OpenAI, and Block, consolidates even open-source contributions into a consortium controlled by incumbents.

This concentration matters ethically for three reasons:

**First, it creates asymmetric capability.** When a corporation can deploy autonomous agents that plan, decide, and act across domains while individuals and smaller organizations cannot, the resulting power imbalance is not merely economic. It is *political* in the deepest sense: it determines who can shape reality and who is shaped by it.

**Second, it occurs without democratic authorization.** No electorate voted to grant a handful of Silicon Valley companies the ability to deploy autonomous decision-making systems that affect billions of lives. The concentration of AI power represents a de facto transfer of governance capability from democratic institutions to private corporations --- what political theorists would recognize as a privatization of sovereignty.

**Third, it is self-reinforcing.** AI capability begets data, which begets better AI, which begets more data. The feedback loop creates what economists call "increasing returns to scale" and what political theorists call "structural power" --- the ability to shape the rules of the game itself, not merely to win within existing rules.

### Who Loses

The evidence suggests three populations bear disproportionate costs:

- **Young and entry-level workers** face a 13% employment decline in AI-exposed jobs and a 35% decline in entry-level postings since 2023 --- precisely the demographic least equipped to absorb economic disruption.
- **The Global South** remains largely excluded from AI governance (118 countries are party to no significant international AI governance initiative) while bearing the downstream consequences of AI systems trained on data that "frequently fails to reflect and cater to the needs, languages, and cultural contexts" of non-Western societies.
- **Small and mid-sized organizations** lack the capital, talent, and infrastructure to develop or even meaningfully customize agentic AI systems, making them consumers of capabilities defined by the same corporations with whom they compete.

### Counterarguments and Their Limits

Proponents argue that open-source AI and decreasing costs will democratize access. This has some merit: open-weight models do lower barriers to entry. However, the argument conflates *access to models* with *access to capability*. Running a frontier model requires computational infrastructure, engineering talent, and institutional context that remain inaccessible to most of the world's population and institutions. The analogy to earlier democratization narratives (personal computing, the internet) is instructive: those technologies did broaden access while simultaneously creating new concentrations of power (FAANG companies, surveillance capitalism). There is no reason to expect agentic AI to follow a different pattern, and considerable reason to expect the concentration to be more extreme given the capital intensity involved.

### Ethical Assessment

From a **justice perspective** (Rawlsian), the current trajectory fails the difference principle: the technology's benefits accrue disproportionately to those already advantaged, while its costs fall disproportionately on the disadvantaged. From a **democratic theory perspective**, the concentration of autonomous decision-making capability in unaccountable private entities represents a threat to self-governance regardless of whether those entities use their power benevolently.

## 2. Human Agency & Skill Atrophy: The "Use It or Lose It" Problem

### The Evidence Is No Longer Hypothetical

The deskilling hypothesis has moved from theoretical concern to documented phenomenon across multiple professional domains:

- **Medicine:** A 2025 study published in *The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology* found that endoscopists who routinely used AI assistance in colonoscopies experienced a measurable decline in unassisted performance --- detection rates for precancerous lesions dropped from 28.4% to 22.4% when AI access was removed. This represents a clinically significant degradation of diagnostic skill with direct consequences for patient safety.

- **Law:** Researchers at Illinois Law School found that law students who relied on generative AI tools were "more prone to critical errors," raising concerns about systemic deskilling of the next generation of legal professionals.

- **Accounting:** An organizational study documented how reliance on automated systems "fostered complacency and eroded staff awareness, competence, and the ability to assess outputs," with employees eventually unable to perform core accounting tasks when the system was unavailable.

- **Education:** A study by Michael Gerlich at SBS Swiss Business School demonstrated a link between increased AI tool reliance and diminished critical thinking abilities, identifying "cognitive offloading" as the primary mechanism.

- **Knowledge work broadly:** Microsoft Research's 2025 survey found knowledge workers "ceding problem-solving expertise to the system," focusing on functional tasks (gathering and integrating AI outputs) rather than substantive analysis.

### The Structural Nature of the Problem

Recent scholarship, particularly from AI & Society (Springer), argues that AI deskilling is not merely an individual failure of discipline but a *structural problem*. The concept of "capacity-hostile environments" describes conditions where AI mediation systematically impedes human capacity cultivation. The key insight is that the same design choices that make AI tools efficient --- seamless automation, reduced cognitive load, frictionless delegation --- are precisely the choices that erode human skill.

This creates what we might call the **comfort trap**: the better AI works, the less humans practice; the less humans practice, the more dependent they become; the more dependent they become, the more catastrophic the consequences of AI failure. Gartner's projection that by 2030, half of enterprises will face *irreversible* skill shortages in at least two critical roles is not alarmist --- it follows directly from the dynamics already observable.

### The Cognitive Dependency Paradox

The Communications of the ACM documented what they term "The AI Deskilling Paradox": AI tools simultaneously make workers more productive *and* less capable. This paradox is not resolvable through better design or training programs alone, because it arises from a fundamental tension: to benefit from AI assistance, you must delegate; to maintain competence, you must practice; delegation and practice are, for many tasks, mutually exclusive activities.

### Philosophical Dimensions

**Virtue ethics** provides the most penetrating analysis of skill atrophy. From an Aristotelian perspective, excellence (arete) requires the habitual exercise of capacity. A doctor who never diagnoses, a lawyer who never reasons through a case, an engineer who never debugs --- these are not merely less skilled professionals but, in a meaningful sense, *less fully realized* professionals. The virtues of their practice --- clinical judgment, legal reasoning, engineering intuition --- require continuous cultivation. When AI takes over the activities through which these virtues are developed, it does not merely affect productivity; it affects the character of the practitioners.

**Kantian ethics** raises a different concern: if human dignity is connected to rational autonomy, and if AI systems erode the capacity for independent rational judgment, then the use of such systems may undermine the very foundation of human moral standing --- not through coercion, but through the gentle atrophy of disuse.

### Where Reasonable People Disagree

Some argue that skill atrophy is an acceptable trade-off if AI systems are sufficiently reliable. If the AI never fails, the human backup capability is unnecessary. This argument has two weaknesses: first, no AI system achieves perfect reliability (and agentic systems have documented failure modes including prompt injection, hallucination, and cascading errors); second, it assumes that human skill has only instrumental value (useful when the machine breaks) rather than intrinsic value (constitutive of human flourishing and professional identity). Both assumptions are contestable, and the second involves deep philosophical commitments about the nature of human good.

## 3. Information Ecosystem: Truth Decay and Epistemic Crisis

### The Structure of the Crisis

The information ecosystem challenge posed by agentic AI and generative media is not primarily about individual deepfakes --- it is about the *systemic erosion of epistemic trust*. UNESCO's analysis describes this as a "crisis of knowing": when synthetic media becomes indistinguishable from authentic media, the default assumption shifts from "this is probably real" to "this could be fake." That shift --- what researchers call the "liar's dividend" --- is more damaging than any individual piece of misinformation.

The Centre for Digital Ethics frames this as "epistemic collapse": "not just believing false things, but losing confidence that we can know anything at all." When completely genuine content is dismissed as "probably AI," the collapse is complete: the existence of deepfakes has undermined trust in *all* media without any specific deepfake needing to succeed.

### The Emotional Persistence Problem

Research demonstrates a particularly troubling finding: even when people are explicitly told that deepfake evidence is fabricated, they remain emotionally swayed by it. This challenges the assumption that transparency and fact-checking are sufficient countermeasures. The human cognitive architecture processes emotional content faster and more durably than rational corrections. Agentic AI systems that can generate and distribute emotionally compelling synthetic content at scale exploit a fundamental vulnerability in human cognition that awareness alone cannot address.

### The Detection Arms Race

The technological response --- building better detection tools --- faces structural limitations:

- Detection is inherently harder than generation (an asymmetry familiar from cybersecurity)
- Each advance in detection capability provides training data for more evasive generation
- Expert consensus is shifting toward fingerprinting *authentic* media rather than detecting *synthetic* media, implicitly conceding that detection of fakes at scale may be infeasible
- Major platforms are already struggling to identify AI-generated content, and the gap is widening

### The Agentic Amplification

Agentic AI adds a new dimension to the information crisis. Previous synthetic media required human direction --- someone had to decide what deepfake to create, where to distribute it, and how to amplify it. Autonomous agents can potentially automate the entire disinformation pipeline: identifying targets, generating tailored content, selecting distribution channels, and adapting strategy based on engagement metrics. This is not merely faster disinformation; it is *autonomous* disinformation with feedback loops that optimize for impact without continuous human guidance.

### Ethical Analysis

From a **consequentialist** perspective, the information ecosystem degradation threatens democratic governance, market integrity, interpersonal trust, and the scientific enterprise --- virtually every institution that depends on shared factual ground. The expected disutility is enormous and broadly distributed.

From a **deontological** perspective, the mass production of synthetic media designed to deceive violates the Kantian prohibition on treating people merely as means (manipulation treats the manipulated person's rational autonomy as an obstacle rather than an end). More broadly, it violates what we might call a *duty to epistemic environment* --- an obligation not to degrade the shared informational commons on which rational agency depends.

From a **care ethics** perspective, the erosion of trust undermines the relationships of care and mutual dependence that constitute the fabric of social life. When a parent cannot trust that a video of their child's school is authentic, when a patient cannot trust that medical information is reliable, when a voter cannot trust that a candidate's statements are real --- the relational foundations of caring for one another are damaged.

## 4. Democratic Implications: When Capability Concentrates

### The Scale of the Challenge

A January 2026 Carnegie Endowment report maps the intersections of AI and democracy, identifying threats across multiple dimensions: electoral integrity, public discourse, institutional capacity, and the distribution of political power. Their assessment is sobering: AI advancements "are occurring at such a scale and speed that it is almost impossible for any government, company, or individual to predict future trajectories or how they will reshape societies."

The Berkman Klein Center at Harvard specifically warns that AI is "poised to play a more volatile role than ever before" in the 2026 U.S. midterm elections, with "little prospect of regulatory action and no safeguards against the dramatic potential impacts for democracy."

### Three Democratic Threats

**1. The Capability Gap as Political Power**

When a small number of corporations possess autonomous systems that can analyze, plan, and act across domains at superhuman speed and scale, they possess a form of political power that is not captured by traditional frameworks of corporate influence (lobbying, campaign finance, regulatory capture). This is *operational* power --- the ability to shape outcomes directly through autonomous action, not merely to influence human decision-makers. A corporation that can deploy thousands of autonomous agents to analyze regulatory environments, optimize public messaging, coordinate legal strategies, and manage stakeholder relationships simultaneously possesses capabilities that dwarf those available to any democratic institution, civil society organization, or individual citizen.

**2. Epistemic Manipulation at Scale**

The combination of deepfake generation, targeted distribution, and autonomous optimization creates tools for political manipulation that are qualitatively different from previous propaganda techniques. A 2025 survey found 55% of respondents "very concerned" about AI-generated content heightening political violence and polarization. When political campaigns, foreign adversaries, or domestic extremists can deploy autonomous agents to generate and distribute tailored disinformation to millions of individuals simultaneously, the conditions for informed democratic deliberation are structurally undermined.

**3. The Governance Speed Gap**

Democratic governance is deliberate by design: it requires debate, negotiation, compromise, and public accountability. AI capability advances on technology timescales. The resulting "governance speed gap" means that by the time democratic institutions develop regulatory responses, the technology has already reshaped the landscape those regulations were designed to govern. This is not merely a practical challenge but a structural threat to democratic self-governance: a society that cannot govern a technology that reshapes its fundamental institutions is, to that extent, not self-governing.

### The Partisan Dimension

Research from the Brennan Center for Justice and others documents a deepening partisan divide on AI governance: one political coalition emphasizes consumer protection and resistance to corporate power concentration, while another casts doubt on any regulation of the AI industry. This divergence itself becomes a vector for AI-driven manipulation, as autonomous systems can exploit partisan divisions to prevent coordinated governance responses.

### What Democracy Requires

Democratic theory, from Habermas's communicative action to Dewey's democratic experimentalism, presupposes certain conditions: access to reliable information, capacity for rational deliberation, rough equality of political voice, and institutional mechanisms for collective decision-making. Agentic AI, as currently developing, threatens each of these conditions. It does not follow that the technology is inherently anti-democratic, but it does follow that preserving democratic governance in the age of agentic AI requires *active* intervention, not passive hope that the technology will be used benevolently.

## 5. Moral Responsibility: The Accountability Fracture

### The Nature of the Gap

Traditional moral responsibility requires several conditions: the agent acted voluntarily, the agent could have done otherwise, the agent had relevant knowledge, and there is a causal connection between the agent's action and the outcome. Agentic AI fractures each of these conditions:

- **Voluntariness:** When a user instructs an agent to "handle my email" and the agent sends a message that causes harm, the user acted voluntarily in delegating but did not voluntarily choose the specific harmful action. The agent "acted" but is not a moral agent. Neither party fully satisfies the voluntariness condition.

- **Alternative possibilities:** The user could have chosen not to delegate, but could not have predicted the specific harmful action. The AI system operated deterministically (or stochastically) within its parameters --- it could not have "chosen" otherwise in any morally relevant sense. The condition of alternative possibilities is distributed across parties in a way that neither fully satisfies it.

- **Knowledge:** The user lacked knowledge of the specific action the agent would take. The AI system possesses no knowledge in the morally relevant sense (understanding, appreciation of consequences, awareness of normative implications). The epistemic condition for responsibility is unfulfilled.

- **Causation:** The causal chain runs from user instruction through AI processing (often opaque) to autonomous action. The more steps the agent takes independently, the more attenuated the causal connection between human intent and outcome becomes.

### Competing Philosophical Positions

**The "No Gap" Position:** Philosopher Matthew Kiener (2025, *Journal of Applied Philosophy*) argues that the responsibility gap is "incoherent and misguided," proposing instead that responsibility distributes across existing human actors --- developers, deployers, users --- without any genuine gap. On this view, existing frameworks are sufficient if properly applied.

**The "Control Gap" Position:** Researchers in *Inquiry* (2024) argue that the core issue is not moral agency but *control*: responsibility gaps arise when there is a discrepancy between the causal control an agent exercises and the moral control it should possess. This reframes the problem from metaphysics to governance: the question is not whether AI is a moral agent but whether humans maintain sufficient control to bear responsibility.

**The "Distributed Responsibility" Position:** Emerging frameworks view moral responsibility not as an individual trait but as a role within a socio-technical system, distributed among human and artificial agents. This draws on systems theory and organizational ethics to argue that responsibility in complex socio-technical systems is always distributed, and agentic AI merely makes this more visible.

**The "Structural Responsibility" Position:** Drawing on work in political philosophy and structural injustice (Iris Marion Young), some argue that the appropriate response is not to locate individual responsibility but to acknowledge *structural* responsibility --- the collective obligation to design, govern, and maintain AI systems in ways that prevent harm. On this view, the accountability gap is a feature of systemic design choices, not merely individual actions.

### The Legal Frontier

As of February 2026, no court has issued a definitive ruling on liability for fully autonomous agent behavior. The EU Product Liability Directive (implementation deadline December 2026) will classify AI as a "product" subject to strict liability. Several U.S. states (Texas, Colorado) are establishing frameworks, but the legal landscape remains fragmented. Legal experts predict the first major lawsuits arising from autonomous AI agent actions in 2026.

### Ethical Assessment

The moral responsibility question is genuinely difficult, and reasonable people disagree. However, several conclusions seem defensible:

1. The "no gap" position is too optimistic: when an autonomous agent takes a chain of actions that no human predicted, intended, or could have prevented, traditional responsibility attribution is strained regardless of how we distribute it.
2. The "control gap" reframing is productive: it shifts attention from metaphysical questions about AI moral agency to practical questions about human oversight.
3. Structural responsibility is essential: regardless of how individual cases are adjudicated, there is a collective obligation to design systems that preserve meaningful human control.
4. The current pace of deployment --- with 79% of organizations deploying AI agents while legal frameworks remain undeveloped --- represents an ethical failure of governance, creating foreseeable harms without established mechanisms for accountability.

## 6. The Augmentation vs. Replacement Question

### The Empirical Collapse of the Distinction

The augmentation-vs-replacement framing has been the dominant rhetorical framework for discussing AI's impact on work: AI will *augment* human workers, not *replace* them. Recent empirical evidence suggests this distinction, while politically comfortable, may be analytically misleading.

Research presented at the American Economic Association (2025) analyzing millions of job postings revealed a striking finding: there is a 0.87 correlation between roles experiencing the greatest automation effects and those experiencing the greatest augmentation effects. In concrete terms, the same jobs are being both enhanced and hollowed out simultaneously. Skills most exposed to AI automation saw demand decline by 16%, while skills most exposed to augmentation saw demand increase by 7%. The net effect is not "augmentation" or "replacement" but *transformation* --- a fundamental restructuring of what the job involves.

### Three Reasons the Distinction Fails

**1. Temporal instability.** A task that is "augmented" today (human does it with AI assistance) may be "replaced" tomorrow (AI does it autonomously) as systems improve. The augmentation phase may be a transitional stage on the path to replacement rather than a stable equilibrium. Claiming a task is "augmented, not replaced" may simply mean "not replaced *yet*."

**2. Qualitative transformation.** When AI handles the substantive cognitive work and the human role reduces to reviewing, approving, and managing AI outputs, the nature of the work has fundamentally changed even if the job title persists. A radiologist who reviews AI-generated diagnoses rather than reading images directly is doing a different job, engaging different skills, and exercising a different kind of judgment. Calling this "augmentation" obscures the qualitative transformation.

**3. Skill composition shift.** When Microsoft Research found knowledge workers "ceding problem-solving expertise to the system" and focusing on "functional tasks" (gathering/integrating responses), this represents neither augmentation nor replacement but a *recomposition* of the work that shifts value from human judgment to human management of AI judgment. Whether this represents an enhancement or a diminishment depends on contestable value judgments about what makes work meaningful.

### The Amplification Alternative

Psychology Today (January 2026) proposes a third category: *amplification*, where AI "becomes a mirror and multiplier of what makes each of us irreducibly human." This framing is aspirational rather than descriptive --- it describes what we might want the human-AI relationship to be rather than what it currently is. Its value is in articulating a normative goal: design AI systems that amplify distinctively human capacities rather than replacing or merely augmenting them.

### Ethical Implications

The collapse of the augmentation/replacement distinction matters ethically because the "augmentation" narrative has served as the primary ethical justification for rapid AI deployment. If AI merely augments human workers, the ethical calculus is straightforward: more capability, same agency, clear benefit. But if "augmentation" actually involves qualitative transformation of work, progressive deskilling, and transitional dependence on the path to replacement, then the ethical calculus is far more complex, requiring attention to:

- Who bears the transition costs?
- What happens to workers whose augmented roles are subsequently automated?
- What responsibility do employers and AI companies bear for skill degradation that occurs during the "augmentation" phase?
- Is there a duty to preserve human skill even when AI can perform the task more efficiently?

## 7. Informed Consent in the Age of Autonomous Agents

### The Structural Problem

Informed consent requires that the person consenting understands what they are consenting to and that they are able to make a meaningful choice. Agentic AI systems challenge both conditions:

**Unpredictability:** Autonomous agents can take chains of actions that were not anticipated by either the user or the developer. When an agent is instructed to "optimize my schedule," the user cannot know in advance what specific actions the agent will take --- rescheduling meetings, declining invitations, accessing contacts, sending messages. The more autonomous the agent, the less predictable its behavior, and the less meaningful any prior consent becomes.

**Complexity:** The technical systems underlying agentic AI --- large language models, tool-use capabilities, memory systems, multi-agent orchestration --- are opaque even to experts. Asking a user to provide "informed consent" to the actions of a system whose behavior cannot be predicted or explained is a form of consent theater rather than genuine informed consent.

**Delegation chains:** When an AI agent acts on behalf of a user in interactions with other systems, services, or people, the consent question cascades: Did the user consent to this specific interaction? Did the other party consent to interact with an AI agent rather than the human? Did either party understand the implications? Current systems, as noted by researchers, "aren't designed to distinguish 'the customer' from 'the customer's agent,'" creating situations where consent is structurally impossible.

### The Healthcare Parallel

The Petrie-Flom Center at Harvard Law School (2025) examines how AI and big data are "changing the rules" of informed consent, noting that traditional informed consent frameworks were designed for discrete, comprehensible interventions --- not for continuous, autonomous, and opaque AI systems that evolve over time. The challenge in healthcare is particularly acute because the stakes are high and the regulatory frameworks for consent are well-developed, yet even these frameworks are proving inadequate for agentic AI.

### Proposed Solutions and Their Limitations

**Granular permission systems:** Treating AI agents like third-party applications with explicit permission grants for each capability. This helps but faces a combinatorial explosion: a sufficiently capable agent may need thousands of permissions, making review impractical.

**Least-privilege and time-limited delegation:** Granting minimal permissions for specific tasks with automatic expiration. This is sound engineering practice but does not address the fundamental consent problem: the user still cannot predict what the agent will do within its authorized scope.

**Transaction-based consent:** Requiring user approval for each significant action. This preserves consent at the cost of defeating the purpose of autonomous agents --- if humans must approve each action, the agent is not autonomous.

### Ethical Assessment

The informed consent challenge is not amenable to simple technical fixes because it arises from a genuine tension between autonomy (delegating to agents to achieve goals more effectively) and control (understanding and approving what agents do). Any system that resolves this tension entirely in favor of autonomy (fully autonomous agents) sacrifices consent; any system that resolves it entirely in favor of control (human approval for everything) sacrifices the efficiency gains that motivate agent use.

This tension is not new --- it exists in every delegation relationship (employer-employee, client-attorney, patient-physician). But in human delegation, the delegate possesses moral understanding, professional judgment, and legal accountability. AI agents possess none of these, making the delegation relationship structurally different from its human analogues in ways that current consent frameworks do not adequately address.

## 8. Structural Inequality: Amplifying the Divide

### The "Next Great Divergence"

The UNDP's assessment of AI's impact on global inequality is titled "The Next Great Divergence" --- a deliberate invocation of the economic divergence between industrializing and non-industrializing nations in the 19th century. The parallel is apt: like industrialization, AI capability concentrates in a small number of countries and corporations, creating self-reinforcing advantages that may be structurally irreversible.

### Six Dimensions of the AI Divide

Building on the seed report's identification of six divides (data, income, usage, global, industry, energy), our ethical analysis examines the *structural mechanisms* through which agentic AI deepens each:

**1. Data divide:** AI systems are trained on data overwhelmingly from Western, English-speaking, technologically advanced societies. Systems deployed in other contexts inherit biases, blind spots, and assumptions that systematically disadvantage non-Western populations. This is not merely a technical problem (fixable with better data) but a structural one: the populations with the most data have the most AI capability, which generates more data, which increases their capability further.

**2. Infrastructure divide:** Running frontier AI models requires computational resources, reliable electricity, and high-bandwidth connectivity that remain unavailable to large portions of the global population. The promise of "open-source AI" rings hollow when the hardware to run it costs millions of dollars.

**3. Talent divide:** AI development requires specialized expertise concentrated in a handful of technology hubs. Brain drain from developing countries to AI corporations in the U.S. and China further depletes the talent available for local AI development.

**4. Governance divide:** 118 countries are party to no significant international AI governance initiative. The rules governing AI are being written by and for the countries that develop it, with limited input from those most affected.

**5. Labor market divide:** High-skilled workers benefit from AI augmentation while low- and middle-skilled workers face displacement. Within countries, this exacerbates income inequality. Between countries, it threatens to make low-cost labor --- the primary comparative advantage of developing economies --- economically irrelevant.

**6. Cultural and linguistic divide:** AI systems perform best in English and a few other widely-represented languages. Speakers of underrepresented languages receive systematically worse service, reinforcing linguistic and cultural marginalization.

### The Education Fault Line

UNICEF's analysis identifies the AI divide as "a new fault line we cannot ignore," noting that AI in education offers genuine potential for personalized learning and accessibility --- but only where schools have "strong digital infrastructure," which excludes precisely the students who would benefit most. A 2026 Frontiers in Computer Science study documents how AI in education risks becoming "a public capability or private advantage," deepening the educational inequality it could theoretically address.

### Ethical Analysis Across Frameworks

**Rawlsian justice:** The current distribution of AI benefits and burdens violates both the difference principle (inequality should benefit the least advantaged) and fair equality of opportunity (everyone should have meaningful access to the benefits of technological progress).

**Capability approach (Sen/Nussbaum):** AI should expand human capabilities broadly, not concentrate them narrowly. When AI systems are inaccessible to large populations, or when they degrade the capabilities of those they displace, they fail the capability standard.

**Global justice (Pogge):** Wealthy nations and corporations developing AI systems that systematically disadvantage developing nations bear a *structural* responsibility for the resulting inequality, even if no individual actor intends discriminatory outcomes.

## 9. Ethical Framework Analysis

| Framework | Assessment of Agentic AI | Key Tensions | What It Illuminates |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Consequentialism (Utilitarian)** | Mixed: Productivity gains are real but distributional consequences are deeply unequal. Net welfare depends entirely on whether gains are broadly shared or concentrated. Currently, evidence favors concentration. | Aggregate welfare vs. distribution; short-term productivity vs. long-term skill erosion and dependency; measurable economic benefits vs. harder-to-quantify harms to trust, autonomy, and democratic governance. | The importance of *distribution*, not just magnitude, of consequences. A technology that produces $490B in annual benefits while deepening inequality may produce negative expected utility when distributional effects are weighted. |
| **Deontological (Kantian)** | Concerning: Agentic AI threatens rational autonomy through skill erosion, information manipulation, and delegation of judgment. Using people's cognitive vulnerabilities for manipulation (deepfakes, persuasion optimization) treats them as means. | Duty to develop beneficial technology vs. duty to respect autonomy; duty to innovate vs. duty not to create systems that undermine rational agency; treating AI workers as replaceable means vs. respecting their dignity as ends. | The intrinsic value of human rational agency, independent of outcomes. Even if AI delegation is efficient, it may wrong people by eroding their capacity for autonomous judgment. |
| **Virtue Ethics (Aristotelian)** | Deeply concerning: Delegation to AI erodes the habitual practice through which professional and intellectual virtues are cultivated. "Excellence" (arete) requires exercise; AI substitution eliminates the conditions for flourishing. | Efficiency vs. excellence; convenience vs. character development; productivity gains vs. professional identity and meaning; the possibility that the "good life" requires struggle and practice, not optimal outcomes. | The *qualitative* dimension of human activity. A doctor who delegates diagnosis may be more productive but is, in a meaningful sense, less fully a doctor. Virtue ethics insists this matters. |
| **Care Ethics (Noddings, Held)** | Significant concerns: AI intermediation in care relationships (healthcare, education, social services) alters the relational fabric. Epistemic trust collapse damages the conditions for caring relationships. | Scalability of care vs. authenticity of care relationships; AI-enhanced accessibility vs. depersonalization of care; efficiency of AI caregivers vs. the moral significance of human attention and presence. | The relational dimension of AI impacts. Care ethics insists that we evaluate AI not just by outcomes or principles but by its effects on the web of caring relationships that constitute human social life. |
| **Political Philosophy (Rawls, Habermas, Young)** | Alarming: Power concentration, democratic capability gaps, epistemic manipulation, and structural inequality each represent threats to the conditions for just political institutions. Collectively, they constitute a systemic challenge. | Innovation vs. equity; national competitiveness vs. global justice; private sector dynamism vs. democratic governance; speed of technological change vs. deliberative pace of democratic decision-making. | The political stakes of technological choices. AI is not merely an economic or technical phenomenon but a reshaping of political power that requires political, not merely technical, responses. |

## 10. Underexamined Ethical Concerns

Several ethical dimensions of agentic AI are not yet receiving adequate attention in public discourse or academic analysis:

### 10.1 The Habituation Problem

Beyond measurable skill atrophy, there is a subtler concern: humans habituated to AI assistance may lose not just skills but the *disposition* to exercise independent judgment. This is different from forgetting how to do something; it is losing the habit of *trying*. The Microsoft Research finding that workers "cede problem-solving expertise" suggests not just skill loss but motivational shift --- a reorientation of the self toward dependence that may be harder to reverse than skill retraining.

### 10.2 Moral Deskilling

If humans delegate ethical judgment to AI systems (content moderation, hiring decisions, criminal justice risk assessment), the capacity for moral reasoning itself may atrophy. Just as medical deskilling degrades diagnostic judgment, moral deskilling could degrade the capacity for ethical deliberation. This concern is rarely discussed because it involves a particularly uncomfortable implication: the technology we use to make "fairer" decisions may be eroding our capacity to make fair decisions ourselves.

### 10.3 The Consent of the Affected

Current consent frameworks focus on the *user* of AI systems. But agentic AI acts in the world, affecting people who never consented to interact with it. When an AI hiring agent screens out a candidate, when an AI customer service agent denies a claim, when an AI content moderator removes a post --- the affected party had no say in the deployment of the system, no opportunity to understand its operation, and limited recourse. This is not adequately addressed by user-focused consent frameworks.

### 10.4 Temporal Justice

The costs and benefits of agentic AI are distributed across time in ways that raise intergenerational justice concerns. Current workers bear displacement costs while future generations may benefit from productivity gains (or may inherit degraded skills, information environments, and democratic institutions). The discount rate applied to future benefits is itself an ethical choice with profound implications.

### 10.5 The Autonomy Paradox

The deepest philosophical puzzle of agentic AI is what we might call the autonomy paradox: people exercise their autonomy to delegate decision-making to AI agents, which then reduces their capacity for autonomous decision-making in the future. Is this a legitimate exercise of autonomy (I choose to delegate) or a self-defeating one (my choice erodes my capacity to choose)? The philosophical literature on paternalism, addiction, and Ulysses contracts is relevant but not fully adequate, because the erosion is gradual, distributed, and non-obvious rather than dramatic and immediate.

### 10.6 The Dignity of Labor

If agentic AI makes many forms of human labor unnecessary, what happens to the connection between work and dignity? For many people, meaningful work is a core component of identity, purpose, and social standing. The question is not merely economic (can displaced workers find new jobs?) but existential (what happens to human self-understanding when the activities that defined it are performed by machines?). This concern resists the "new jobs will emerge" response because it is not about *employment* but about *meaning*.

### 10.7 Environmental Justice

The computational infrastructure for agentic AI requires enormous energy --- training runs, inference at scale, data centers. The environmental costs of this energy consumption are distributed globally and intergenerationally, borne disproportionately by communities near power plants and data centers and by future generations inheriting a destabilized climate. This environmental dimension is typically treated as a technical challenge (renewable energy, efficiency improvements) rather than an ethical one, but it involves genuine questions of distributive justice.

## 11. Conclusions and Tensions

This analysis does not end with recommendations, because the appropriate responses to these ethical challenges depend on value commitments about which reasonable people disagree. Instead, we conclude with the central tensions that any ethical response must navigate:

**Efficiency vs. Agency:** Agentic AI offers genuine productivity gains, but at the cost of human skill, judgment, and the disposition to exercise them. There is no technical solution to this tension; it requires a societal decision about the relative value of efficiency and human capability.

**Innovation vs. Governance:** The pace of AI development outstrips the pace of democratic governance. Slowing development protects democratic institutions but may cede advantage to less constrained actors. This is a genuine dilemma, not a false one.

**Individual benefit vs. Collective risk:** Each individual organization rationally benefits from deploying agentic AI, but the collective effect of universal deployment may include skill erosion, information degradation, and power concentration that harm everyone. This is a classic collective action problem requiring coordination, not merely individual choice.

**Present gains vs. Future costs:** The productivity benefits of agentic AI are immediate and measurable; the costs (skill erosion, democratic degradation, inequality) are diffuse, delayed, and harder to quantify. This temporal asymmetry systematically biases decision-making toward deployment.

**Autonomy vs. Protection:** Individuals should be free to use AI tools as they choose, but collective effects of individual choices (skill erosion, information ecosystem degradation) may justify protective interventions. The boundary between legitimate governance and paternalism is contested.

These tensions are not solvable by any single ethical framework or policy intervention. They represent the genuine moral complexity of a technology that is simultaneously beneficial and threatening, empowering and diminishing, democratizing and concentrating. Honest engagement with this complexity --- resisting both techno-optimist dismissal and techno-pessimist despair --- is the beginning of ethical seriousness about agentic AI.
